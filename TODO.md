# Descipline Mobile DApp Migration Plan

## 📱 Project Overview
Migrating Descipline functionality from `amigo-sol-dapp` to the new `descipline-dapp-mobile` project based on Solana's official `web3js-expo-paper` template.

## 🎯 Migration Strategy
1. **Maintain Template Stability** - Keep the official template structure intact

- Implement real contract interaction for stake and create transactions

## 🚨 Critical Differences to Handle

### Navigation Structure
- **Template**: Uses `(tabs)` folder with nested routes
- **Amigo**: Uses flat structure with `_layout.tsx` files
- **Strategy**: Keep template structure, adapt amigo screens

### Wallet Integration
- **Template**: Has auth provider with mobile wallet adapter
- **Amigo**: Has more complex universal wallet system
- **Strategy**: Use template's simpler approach

### UI Library
- **Template**: React Native Paper
- **Amigo**: Custom components + expo-symbols
- **Strategy**: Adapt to Paper components, maintain Solana theme

### State Management
- **Template**: Basic React Context
- **Amigo**: Context + TanStack Query
- **Strategy**: Keep template pattern, add Query where needed

## 📌 Priority Order

1. **Get IDL and types working** (Phase 2)
2. **Basic challenge list display** (Phase 5)
3. **Challenge details view** (Phase 5)
4. **Participation flow** (Phase 6)
5. **Creation flow** (Phase 6)
6. **Profile features** (Phase 8)
